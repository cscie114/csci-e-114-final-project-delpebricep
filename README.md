# CSCI E-114 Final Project | Quiz Land

## Project Site
https://quiz-land.netlify.app/


## About
My final project is a Gatsby website that uses [The Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com/) to generate random collections of trivia questions and display each of them as interactive quiz games. Users can answer questions and submit their scores to online leaderboards hosted on MongoDB Atlas.


## Application Local Setup

### Step 1: Installation

To install this project, you must first clone this repository. 
Next, use your preferred shell/terminal application to navigate to the project's folder with ```cd csci-e-114-final-project-delpebricep```.

While in the project's directory, run ```npm install``` to install the project's NPM dependencies.


### Step 2: MongoDB Setup

**NOTE:** Teaching instructors may skip to Step 3, as they can use the .env file submitted through Canvas to handle MongoDB credentials.

In order for the leaderboard feature and Netlify functions to work locally, you will need to make a MongoDB database.
[Follow these instructions from the official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database) to set one up. I recommend making a free MongoDB Atlas account and hosting the database there so it can be up at all times.


### Step 3: Creating an Environment File

Create a .env file at the root directory of your cloned repository. Go to your MongoDB database and acquire its connection URI, its database name, and the name of the collection you would like to store user scores under. 

The .env file must look like the following:
```
MONGODB_URI="[MongoDB connection URI for your database goes here]"
MONGODB_DATABASE="[MongoDB database name goes here]"
MONGODB_COLLECTION="[MongoDB collection name goes here]"
```

**NOTE:** Teaching instructors may use the .env file submitted through Canvas instead. It contains the MongoDB database credentials I used in the development of this project.


### Step 3: Running the Project

After completing the previous two steps, run ```npm start``` to run the project normally.
To run the project locally with Netlify functions enabled, install the Netlify CLI then run ```netlify dev``.


## Assignment Components and Requirements

### Something New?

Initially, my plan was to transform the "Gatsby Game Museum" (a project I submitted for Assignment #4) ando transform it into a retro video game e-commerce catalogue with the ability to rent and purchase old games. It was essentially going to be Netflix for old Nintendo and SEGA games. It would have used the MobyGames API as a data source for each game and platform page, instead of the IGDB API.

I changed course because said API had strict rate limitations and was giving me a lot of trouble with creating large sets of pages. That and, it did not seem "new" enough- it'd be boring to work on a rehash of some older project.

Because of my personal interest in video games, I opted to make a project that was more interactive and "gamified", so to speak. That is when I came up with creating a quiz website. I believed this approach could make my submission more unique. I had dabbled with game development as a hobby before, but only in environments specialized for the task like Unity, Godot, and Love2D- not in a Jamstack site using React. It sounded like an interesting challenge.

### Data-Driven Content

All of the quiz pages are generated by Gatsby using a series of individual JSON files defining information about each quiz (such as name, difficulty, and the types of questions it should fetch from The Trivia API). This data is located in ```/data/quiz-data/```.

### CI/CD Process

The CI/CD process for this project functions similarly to Assignment #5 and uses GitHub Actions. When a new commit is pushed to the remote GitHub repository, the codebase is linted for JavaScript errors, built, and deployed to Netlify.

While implementing this, I learned that Netlify serverless functions cannot read GitHub repository secrets when the site is built and deployed. To get around this, I had to manually enter my MongoDB-related environment variables (MONGODB_URI, MONGODB_DATABASE, MONGODB_COLLECTION) into the site's settings on Netlify's online dashboard so serverless functions can connect to the database on the production site.

### An "Extraordinary Distinction": Leaderboards with Serverless Functions 

Being an interactive gamified site, I thought it would be a great idea to incoporate leaderboards for each quiz. I wanted to let users view other users' scores and submit their own.
Having previous experience with MongoDB, I spun up a database on MongoDB Atlas and used Netlify's serverless function to connect it to the Gatsby site.

The site also makes use of [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/), a JavaScript library for playing music and sound effects during each quiz game. A purely auditory addition that was fueled by my "video game brained" way of thinking, but I think it added a bit more pizzazz to the quizzes. I also made sure to include a volume slider React component to accomodate those who want their quiz-taking to be more silent.

# CSCI E-114 Final Projcet | Quiz Land

My final project is a Gatsby website that uses [The Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com/) to generate random collections of trivia questions and display each of them as interactive quiz games. Users can answer questions and submit their scores to online leaderboards hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

**Project Site**: https://quiz-land.netlify.app/


## Application Local Setup

### Step 1: Installation

To install this project, you must first clone this repository. 
Next, use your preferred shell/terminal application to navigate to the project's folder (e.g., ```cd csci-e-114-final-project-delpebricep```).

While in the project's directory, run ```npm install``` to install the project's NPM dependencies.


### Step 2: Creating an Environment File

Create a .env file at the root directory of your cloned repository. It must look like the following:

```
MONGODB_URI="[MongoDB connection URI for your database goes here]"
MONGODB_DATABASE="[MongoDB database name goes here]"
MONGODB_COLLECTION="[MongoDB collection name goes here]"
```

**NOTE:** Teaching instructors may use the .env file submitted through Canvas instead. It contains the MongoDB variables I used throughout development of this project.


### Step 3: Running the Project

After completing the previous two steps, run ```npm start``` to run the project normally.
To run the project locally with Netlify functions enabled, install the Netlify CLI then run


## Assignment Components and Requirements

### An "Extraordinary Distinction": Leaderboards with Serverless Functions 

I made use of Netlify's serverless functions to implement Quiz Land's leaderboard feature. The function allows users to query other players' high scores for a certain quiz, as well as submit their own scores. Player names and scores are stored on a MongoDB Atlas database.
